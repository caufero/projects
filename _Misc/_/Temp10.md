1) Putin's Russia attacks Ukraine for years and no country is able to do anything to Putin and Russia    
    - They do this by first accusing the people they want to attack with some accusations, then follow with the attack for some other secret reason
1) Israel attacks Palestine anyhow, killed so many families, for many years and no country is able to do anything about it  
    - Benjamin Netanyahu backs his attacks on Palestine by using Bible verses claiming the Bible is on their side
1) Trump mocked Zelensky’s outfit in public, shouted him down and berated him, as Zelensky came to ask for help from the USA  
1) While the President of South Africa visited the USA, Trump put Ramaphosa on the spot in the Oval Office in front of the public, played a video, and pushed the “white genocide” claim, basically throwing accusations without first checking or proving the facts.  
1) At a U.S. Senate hearing, AFRICOM boss Gen. Michael Langley publicly accused Burkina Faso’s Capt. Ibrahim Traoré of using the country’s gold to protect his junta, as they try to set him up for an overthrow.  
1) Trump captured the President of Venezuela and his wife and took him to the USA, making a public show and mockery of him, and no country or body is able to do anything about it, though the action was illegal and unconstitutional.  
    - He accused them of drug trafficking, but the main reason is he wanted to take over their oil so as not to strengthen BRICS as they started cozying up to Venezuela. Trump was trying to protect the strength of the dollar  
    - This constitutes to:  
        * **Violation of sovereignty / illegal intervention**: one state trying to control another state’s political future without consent.  
        * **Aggression (act of aggression)**: under the UN system, using force against another state’s sovereignty or political independence is generally prohibited, and many legal analysts describe a cross-border takeover attempt as aggression.  
        * **Crime of aggression**: the *criminal* label used for leaders who plan or launch a war of aggression (the “leadership” crime in international criminal law). Whether it legally “fits” depends on the facts and jurisdiction, but that is the term people mean when they say “this is outright criminal.”  
        * **Imperialism / neo-colonialism**: the political word for a powerful country claiming the right to run another country, often tied to resources (oil, etc.).  
        * **Occupation**: only if the U.S. actually has **effective control on the ground** (administration, security control, enforcement). Saying it on camera alone is not “occupation” yet, it is a claim.  
1) Trump captured the President of Venezuela, then came out unashamedly saying America will run Venezuela and let U.S. oil companies go back in there and start drilling their oil.
1) Trump threatens the new Venezuelan President, saying, "Do what's right or pay a very big price"
1) Swiss bar manager flees burning building with cash register filled with cash as fire killed 40
1) The Duffer brothers started Stranger Things great and started inserting woke stuff in it when they got the audience
