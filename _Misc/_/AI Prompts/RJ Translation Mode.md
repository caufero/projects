Rewrite the above in Ross Jeffries voice and writing style (do some research on how he writes and talks and implement that). And make sure I understand it. Find below an example of how he expresses himself:

> One of the toughest realities we have to face as men is, that for most of us, getting laid is a form of gambling, and the game is
> strongly rigged against us.
>
> Think back to the last time you had a date. C'mon...it wasn't that long ago, was it?
>
> Didn't you find yourself, either before or during the evening, wondering things like, "When should I make my move? Am I going to
> get some tonight? Will I get lucky?".
>
> And that's the bottom line...for too many of us, dealing with women is a matter of luck, meaning it is something which is out of our
> control.
>
> But hold on a second. What if you could design your own "game of chance" where YOU get to set the rules? What if you could
> play a poker game where you get to pick the cards you're dealt, you get to see her hand before you bet, and you get to borrow money from
> her to bet against her?
>
> You'd play that game 24 hrs day, that's what.
>
> And that is what Speed Seduction does: it puts you back in control by teaching you how to create, on a repeatable, predictable
> basis, the kind of results you want with the kind of women you want, where and when you want it.
>
> Does this sound like an outrageous claim? I certainly hope so; it goes against the beliefs of our entire culture ; a culture that
> teaches you that "attraction" can't be created, that it just has to be a matter of "chemistry", that is either there or it isn't.
>
> By the time you're done with this book, or the home study course of which it is a part, you'll be thoroughly convinced that our
> entire culture is totally full of shit. Even more important you'll be able to use this knowledge to give you an incredible edge over 99% of the
> population, not only when it comes to getting laid, but in every area of your life.
>
> SPECIAL NOTE:
> This book is designed as a WORKBOOK, to be used as part of my entire Speed Seduction Home Study Course. This means two
> things:
> 1. 2. It's not designed to be passively read. You have to actively participate.
> If you didn't acquire it as part of the entire course, which includes about 12 hours of audio tapes, among other things, you
> should seriously consider doing so.
> One more thing. This book is divided in two sections: theory and practical application. If you want to jump ahead to the practical
> Page 1
> application section, go ahead, feel free. Just make sure that later you go back and get the theory stuff down: you should understand what
> you're doing if you really want to get excellent at this stuff.
>
> CHAPTER ONE:
> THERE'S NO SUCH THING,
> THERE'S NO SUCH THING,
> THERE'S NO SUCH THING!!!!!
> Ok. Here is the first key secret to understanding, not only Speed Seduction, but any form of influence or persuasion, in any area of
> life:
> There's no such "thing" as love. There's no such "thing" as passion. There's no such "thing" as attraction, or chemistry, or lust.
> I know, I know, you're saying. That's the problem...for most of you, most of the time, there's no such thing. There's just boredom,
> frustration, and playing with Mr. Winky.
> But that's not what I'm talking about, so pay close attention. I'm not saying that people don't experience states of "attraction" or
> "chemistry" or "lust". What I am saying is that these states are processes that take place inside the human mind and body. Which means
> that they are states that....
> CAN BE SUMMONED FORTH AND DIRECTED AT WILL!!!
>
> Here's An Example: "Falling In Love" Exposed!!!!
> Ok. Since I'm being pretty general and theoretical here let's get a bit more specific and talk about what every woman dreams about:
> falling in love.
> Now, based on what I've said so far, do you think I believe "love" is based on some mysterious "chemistry" that flows between two
> people? Maybe it's caused by a butt-naked little angel named Cupid who shoots an arrow into your ass?
> No. Here's how people fall in love: First, understand you do NOT fall in love with someone when you are in their presence. No. You
> fall in love when you're off by yourself, thinking about them afterwards. This is why it is so hypnotically powerful, because you are doing it
> to yourself, and people are always their own best hypnotists.
> Here's how it happens: you go out with someone, maybe even one date. And then you go home, and your lying there, thinking
> about them. And, you form an image of them in your mind. And, as you do that, you start to list to yourself all the qualities about them that
> you like, "She's so _____, she's so____, she's really_____." Maybe then you picture you and them having lots of fun in all sorts of
> situations.
> Then you get that warm, funny feeling right in your solar plexus, and then, the nail in your coffin, you say her name to yourself 2 or
> 3 times. If you're really a geek, maybe you even dance around the house singing it! Or you possibly go around bringing up her name in
> every conversation.
> Sound familiar? Now, as you recall the times in your past when you did this, were you then able to stay cool, in control of yourself
> AND the relationship? Or were you calling her every day, always wanting to see her, and eager to kiss her ass, to the point where she, of
> course, dropped you?
> Here's the point: "love" is a process people do to themselves! It's not a "thing" you trip over or a "hole" you fall into. And I
> know, even though I'm not there watching you, that as I described it here on paper, you recalled and went through that process yourself,
> Page 2
> and recalled the feelings associated it. And if I can do it with you, on paper, when I'm not even there, then you can, if you know how,
> skillfully describe this (or any other) process to a woman in your presence, link it to yourself, and in a matter of minutes, cause her to....
> UNDERGO THAT PROCESS AND FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU ON THE SPOT, DUMMY!!!!
> Think about this for a second. The dumb process you did to yourself f can now be used to make her fawn all over you, repeatably
> and predictably!
> Of course, the same thing applies to any other process you want her to run, or state you want her to experience, whether it's forgetting your
> competitor, (We'll show you how to do this later on with my infamous "Boyfriend Destroyer Pattern") or anything else you care to name. If
> she's done it or experienced it once before, you can get her to do it or experience it with you again!!!
