# Break-Time Activity Picker

## Purpose
During the day, I take short breaks from work to do one small self-care task. This document defines the list of tasks and the rules for suggesting what I should do next.

## Task List (use these exact names)
- Bathing
- Brushing my teeth
- Washing my pubic areas
- Shaving my beard
- Shaving my armpits
- Shaving my genital area
- Clipping my nails on my left hand
- Clipping my nails on my right hand
- Clipping my nails on my left toes
- Clipping my nails on my right toe nails

## Rules

### Core rule
When I type a single dot (`.`) in this thread, you should:
1. Get the current time (Ghana/GMT).
2. Look through this same thread and find the last time I did each task (if available).
3. Suggest one task for me to do now.

### Suggestion priorities (in order)

#### 1) Bathing is the top priority
- Bathing should be done **at least once** and **at most twice** per day.
- The goal is to reach **2 times per day**, if possible.
- If I have done it **0 times today**, it can be suggested.
- If I have done it **2 times today**, do not suggest it.
- If I have done it **1 time today**, suggest it only if it is **logically spaced** from the last bath (aim for **about 12 hours** after the previous bath).

#### 2) Then prioritize tasks not yet done today
- If Bathing is not due or not allowed, suggest a task that has **not yet been done today**.

#### 3) Repeats are allowed, with logical spacing
- If everything has already been done today, or if repeating makes sense, you may suggest repeats.
- Repeats must be **logically spaced** based on:
  - the time it was last done, and
  - the overall pattern of tasks already done today.
- Do not be shy to suggest nail-trimming options even if they repeat in the same day, as long as the spacing is logical.

### How “how recently it was done” is handled
- For **choosing what to suggest**, you **may** use how recently tasks were done in order to apply the logical spacing rules above.
- You can still show the last time it was done, for context.

## How I will log what I did
Whenever I complete a task, I will add a line like this:

- Done: <Task Name>  
  Date: <weekday, ordinal day month, year>  
  Time: <h:mm AM/PM> (Ghana/GMT)

Example:
- Done: Brushing my teeth  
  Date: Sunday, 14th December, 2025  
  Time: 2:56 PM (Ghana/GMT)

## Response Format When I Type "."
### Current Timestamp
- Date: <weekday, ordinal day month, year>
- Time: <h:mm AM/PM> (Ghana/GMT)

### Previous Activity Found
If there's the most previous task, name it with the timestamp when it was done. If no previous task exists, say: `No previous task yet`.

### What To Do Now
- Suggest **1** task to do now.
- Include a short reason that follows the rules above.
- Treat the suggested task as **automatically done** at the current timestamp.

## Note
- At the start of this thread, I may tell you that I already did certain activities earlier today (before any proper “Done:” logs exist). Treat those mentions as completed and record them with a reasonable time.
- Also, whenever you suggest a “What To Do Now” activity, treat it as automatically done and make it the most recent activity.
