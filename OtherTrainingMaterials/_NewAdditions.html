> ## Instruction for Inserting Content ##
>
> ### Goal
> Merge the **content above** into the **content below** so the final result reads like **one coherent document** with natural flow.
>
> ### How to Insert the New Content
> Use your discretion to choose the best approach:
>
> 1. **Insert as one block**: place the entire “content above” as a single intact block in the most appropriate location, **or**
> 2. **Insert in parts**: split the “content above” into meaningful pieces and insert each piece into the most relevant section(s) of the content below.
>
> If the content below has no suitable section for any piece, **create a new section or subsection** with a clear heading and place it there.
>
> ### Editing Rules for the Existing Document (Content Below)
> - **Preserve the existing wording and structure** of the content below.
> - Make edits to the content below **only when truly necessary**, for example:
>   - to make the insertion read smoothly,
>   - or to remove/adjust duplicated or redundant text caused by the insertion.
>
> ### Final Output Requirements
> - The result must read like a single, well-organized document.
> - You may **reorder existing sections** if it improves the overall organization after the insertion.
> - Output the final document in **Markdown (md) code**.
