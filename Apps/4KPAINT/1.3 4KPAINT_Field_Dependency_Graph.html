# 4KPAINT Field Dependency Graph

Generated from FileMaker DDR XML: `4KPAINT_fmp12.xml`

Generated on: 2025-12-26 21:48:44 UTC

## What this report includes

- Dependency extraction for:
  - Calculation fields
  - Auto-enter calculations
  - Validation calculations
- Dependencies are extracted using **explicit** `TO::Field` references found in expressions.

## Known limitations

- References that do **not** use `TO::Field` (for example `Quantity * Rate` in the same table) are not reliably detectable from text alone.
- Some DDRs store calculations in slightly different XML shapes; this report uses best-effort extraction.
- Because layout/relationship context is not applied here, `TO` names are reported exactly as referenced in calculations.

## Counts

- Tables scanned: **51**
- Calculation fields found: **316**
- Auto-enter calcs found: **123**
- Validation calcs found: **0**
- Field-level edges written to DOT (capped): **56**
