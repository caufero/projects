  <h2>5. Key Workflows (Step-by-step)</h2>

  <h3>Inventory flow</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Warehouse records stock received (supplier, items, quantity, cost)</li>
    <li>System updates warehouse stock balance</li>
    <li>Warehouse creates a transfer to a store</li>
    <li>Store confirms receipt and quantities</li>
    <li>System updates store stock balance and closes the transfer</li>
    <li>Adjustments require a reason and an approval</li>
    <li>Closing stock and stock counts generate variance reports</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Bespoke order to production to delivery</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Sales rep creates a bespoke order (customer, measurements, delivery date, notes)</li>
    <li>Deposit is recorded with reference details</li>
    <li>Production job is created and sent to factory</li>
    <li>Factory admin assigns a tailor and target dates</li>
    <li>Materials are issued (job issue or bulk issue, confirmed during build)</li>
    <li>Tailor logs work daily and updates job status</li>
    <li>Factory marks the outfit completed and dispatches to store</li>
    <li>Store receives the outfit and updates the order status</li>
    <li>Customer picks up and final payment is recorded</li>
    <li>Order is closed and included in reporting</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Commission and payroll processing</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>System generates monthly totals by store and by staff</li>
    <li>System applies commission rules and calculates commission due</li>
    <li>System generates salary due list</li>
    <li>Admin reviews payroll and submits for approval</li>
    <li>Owner approves payroll if it crosses agreed thresholds</li>
    <li>Finance records payment and closes payroll run</li>
    <li>Audit log records the payroll run history</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Approvals and audit logging</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>User initiates a sensitive action</li>
    <li>System marks it as pending approval and records it</li>
    <li>Approver reviews and approves or rejects with a reason</li>
    <li>Approved actions apply changes and update balances</li>
    <li>Audit logs remain available for reviews and accountability</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>11. Testing and Acceptance</h2>

  <h3>UAT approach</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We run UAT with real scenarios using client-provided sample data</li>
    <li>Each team tests its full workflow:
      <ul>
        <li>Stores test sales and stock</li>
        <li>Warehouse tests receiving and transfers</li>
        <li>Factory tests production and materials</li>
        <li>Finance tests payroll and approvals</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Issues are tracked, fixed, and re-tested until stable</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Acceptance criteria</h3>
  <p>The system is accepted when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Roles and permissions work exactly as agreed</li>
    <li>Inventory balances are correct across warehouse and stores</li>
    <li>Bespoke orders work end-to-end from creation to closure</li>
    <li>Production jobs track status and tailor logs correctly</li>
    <li>Approvals block sensitive actions until approved</li>
    <li>Audit logs show accurate user and timestamp records</li>
    <li>Reports export correctly to PDF and Excel/CSV</li>
    <li>Dashboards match the underlying transactions</li>
    <li>Hosting performance supports daily work without delays</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Bug fixing window</h3>
  <p>Stabilization window: <strong>2 to 4 weeks</strong> after go-live (final based on pricing option)</p>
  <p>Fix priority:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Critical issues first</li>
    <li>Workflow blockers next</li>
    <li>Minor improvements last</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Since records are in a notebook, we recommend starting with opening stock balances and current active orders, then adding history later if needed.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>13. Assumptions and Out-of-Scope</h2>

  <h3>Explicit assumptions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>System is used on desktop in the early rollout</li>
    <li>Commission rules and payroll rules will be signed off before automation goes live</li>
    <li>Pricing method of materials in inventory will be chosen during kickoff</li>
    <li>Client provides a decision maker for quick approvals</li>
    <li>Client provides staff time for UAT and training</li>
    <li>Hosting is FileMaker Cloud or managed FileMaker hosting</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Clear out-of-scope list to prevent scope creep</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Full statutory accounting replacement unless approved as an add-on phase</li>
    <li>MoMo payment confirmation integrations unless added later</li>
    <li>SMS and WhatsApp automation unless added later</li>
    <li>Barcode scanning unless added later</li>
    <li>Hardware procurement and network setup</li>
    <li>Advanced HR modules such as biometric attendance unless added later</li>

  <h2>15. Hosting and Licensing Notes</h2>

  <h3>FileMaker licensing considerations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Each user needs the right FileMaker license based on their access type</li>
    <li>Licensing approach will be confirmed after we confirm user count and roles</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Hosting options (on-prem vs cloud) with pros/cons</h3>

  <div class="link-grid">
    <div class="link-card">
      <div class="link-title">Option 1: FileMaker Cloud or managed hosting provider (recommended)</div>
      <p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

        <li>Easier access across locations</li>
        <li>Faster rollout</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Monthly hosting cost</li>
        <li>Depends on internet at each branch</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="link-card">
      <div class="link-title">Option 2: On-prem FileMaker Server hosted by the client</div>
      <p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Full control under client IT</li>
        <li>Works well with strong internal infrastructure</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Requires server hardware and IT management</li>
        <li>Higher risk if updates and backups are not done properly</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Based on your preference, we recommend managed hosting to keep performance and availability stable across locations.</p>
